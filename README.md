# Trajectory_Generation
Minimum Snap Trajectory generation for quadrotors 

Refer to the paper : https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5980409 

fixed_time_stamps_minsnap.py is the implementation with fixed time segmentation for a given average velocity.

time_optimized_minsnap.py is the implemetation where the time segmentation is optimized using gradient descent.
